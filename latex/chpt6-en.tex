\section{Related Work}

There are already generators that produce social media data. One such generator is DATAGEN, which is a social network data generator, provided by LDBC-SNB 
(Linked Data Benchmark Council - Social Network Benchmark \cite{26}). The LDBC-SNB aims to provide a realistic workload, consisting of a social network and a set of queries. 
DATAGEN is a synthetic data generator responsible for generating datasets for the three LDBC-SNB workloads: the Interactive, the Business Intelligence and the Analytical. 
DATAGEN mimics features of those found in real social network. They create a synthetic dataset due to the fact that it is difficult to find data with all the 
scaling characteristics their benchmark requires and collecting real data can be expensive or simply not possible due to privacy concerns.

Also, there is LFR-Benchmark generator \cite{27} which provides the network structure of a social network, being able to mimic some of the properties of real 
social media. The LFR generator produces social network graphs with power-law degree distribution and with implanted communities within the network.
